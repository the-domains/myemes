            <description><![CDATA[<p>I am Lieba Swartz-Brownstein and I have the dream of opening EMES. EMES stands for Everyone Matters Eating Support and it will be the first Jewish Eating Disorder treatment center in America for women. My dream to open EMES sparked from my own recovery Journey. I myself struggled with a eating disorder for close to a decade before I was able to receive treatment. Being Jewish and going to treatment is no easy task and that is why I have decided to open EMES. Emes in Hebrew means truth because the program I hope to open one day will have the truth and the answer for Jewish Women to recover from there eating disorders. I have been to treatment many times through my journey and each time I have had to work out how to get Kosher food, how to keep Shabbat, and how to find places to Pray. What would it look like if all those things were just given to you? What would it look like if you walked in to a place and you were already understood and you did not need to explain what Kosher is? NEDA (National Eating Disorder Association) says, that with Shabbat, holidays, kashrut, and other details of the Jewish life, the patient can often feel misunderstood or weary of clinicians from other backgrounds. Therefore, the needs of a Jewish patient often times require specific knowledge on the part of the treatment team. The most effective treatment will be from individuals who are culturally sensitive and those that can collaborate with the appropriate treatment team. My dream for EMES: • Is to create a treatment environment where Jewish women feel free to express their faith. • To improve their relationship with G-d through Recovery. • To understand how Judaism plays out in there Eating Disorder. • Help break down the sigma that the orthodox world has created around mental health and Eating Disorders. • Change the Jewish Community. What are the accommodations that will be made in EMES: • Kosher Food • Shabbat meals- Support • Celebration of Holidays • Places to wash for bread • Cups to wash in the morning • Visiting hours not on Shabbat • A space and time to pray • Modest places to change • Women staff Three Programs: • Residential Program • Day Treatment Program • IOP (Intensive Outpatient) Class Options at EMES: • Shabbat Support Class • The place of Food in Jewish Life • Modesty • Dating and Marriage • Self Esteem • Body Image Everyone knows someone with a Eating Disorder- To save one life is to save a world. EMES opening Summer 2022 Make Checks out to Lieba Swartz-Brownstein</p>]]></description>
