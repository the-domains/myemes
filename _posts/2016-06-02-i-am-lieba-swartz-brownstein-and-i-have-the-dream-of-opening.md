I
am Lieba Swartz-Brownstein and I have the dream of opening EMES. EMES stands
for Everyone Matters Eating Support and it will be the first Jewish Eating
Disorder treatment center in America for women. My dream to open EMES sparked
from my own recovery Journey. I myself struggled with a eating disorder for
close to a decade before I was able to receive treatment. Being Jewish and
going to treatment is no easy task and that is why I have decided to open EMES.
Emes in Hebrew means truth because the program I hope to open one day will have
the truth and the answer for Jewish Women to recover from there eating
disorders. I have been to treatment many times through my journey and each time
I have had to work out how to get Kosher food, how to keep Shabbat, and how to
find places to Pray. What would it look like if all those things were just
given to you? What would it look like if you walked in to a place and you were
already understood and you did not need to explain what Kosher is? NEDA
(National Eating Disorder Association) says, that with Shabbat, holidays,
kashrut, and other details of the Jewish life, the patient can often feel
misunderstood or weary of clinicians from other backgrounds. Therefore, the
needs of a Jewish patient often times require specific knowledge on the part of
the treatment team.**The most effective treatment will be from individuals
who are culturally sensitive and those that can collaborate with the
appropriate treatment team.**My
dream for EMES: 

•

Is to create a treatment environment where Jewish women feel free to express their faith. 

•

To improve their relationship with G-d through Recovery. 

•

To understand how Judaism plays out in there Eating Disorder.
